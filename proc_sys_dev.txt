/proc and /sys:

Use Case:

/proc and /sys are virtual filesystems that provide an interface to kernel data and configuration settings.
/proc contains information about running processes, system resources, and kernel parameters.
/sys exposes information about the kernel, devices, and kernel configuration settings.
Difference:

/proc is primarily used for providing information about processes and system resources. It contains pseudo-files representing various aspects of the system.
/sys is used for accessing information about the kernel, devices, and configuring kernel parameters. It provides a structured hierarchy of directories and files representing different kernel attributes.
/dev:

Use Case:

/dev is a directory that contains device files, representing physical and virtual devices on the system.
It allows interaction with devices by reading from or writing to these special files.
Difference:

/dev is focused on providing access to device files, enabling communication with devices such as hard drives, terminals, or random number generators.
/proc and /sys are more about exposing system and kernel-related information, facilitating monitoring and configuration.
In summary, /proc and /sys are virtual filesystems for accessing kernel and system information, while /dev is a directory housing device files, facilitating interaction with devices in the system. Each serves a distinct purpose in managing and interacting with different aspects of the operating system.
